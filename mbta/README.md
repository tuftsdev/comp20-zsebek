/* README.md for mbta lab */

1. I have been able to implement this lab partially (so far), with:
   -The determined geolocation and icon marker to mark it. 
   - An infowindow that is displayed upon clicking the marker for the geolocation, displaying the nearest MBTA station as well as the distance in miles to it
   - A polyline that connects the marker of the user to the nearest MBTA station
   - InfoWindows that display the waiting time for the next 3 trains in either direction (except on the end stops) in minutes if the data is in the JSON document. 

    

2. I have not directly collaborated or discussed the assignment with anyone, although I have followed the discussions on Piazza and utilized the example code provided through Trunk. I have asked questions on Piazza to help get through certain issues I have had with the code. 

3. I have spent approximately 15 hours working on this assignment so far.
