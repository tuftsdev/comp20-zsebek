/* README.md for mbta lab */

1. I have been able to implement this lab correctly, with:
   - A map that takes up the entire page
   - Each station on the map represented by an icon that is not the standard red marker pin
   - A map that is centered on South Station
   - A red polyline that connects the stations, split into 3 sections to accomodate for the fork in the red line
   - A separate CSS and Javascript file 

2. I have not directly collaborated or discussed the assignment with anyone, although I have followed the discussions on Piazza and utilized the example code provided through Trunk.

3. I have spent approximately 6 hours working on this assignment.
