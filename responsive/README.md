README.md -> Responsive Design Lab 5

1. After a lot of experimentation, I have managed to create responsive.css to display the correct images at the correct browser widths. Like some other individuals in the class my browser can't shrink to the smallest size, but the numbers are consistent with the top row of images so I believe that the implementation is correct in the end. First I tested the difference in code for differing widths by using different background colors. After I knew that worked, I implemented the sprite code until it showed up properly for each width.  

2. I have not directly collaborated or discussed this assignment, although I have read the resources from Trunk and posts on Piazza. I used the discussions to help fix some of my syntax errors as I worked through the lab. 

3. So far I have spent about 3 hours working on this assignment.
