Lab 6 README

1. I was able to correctly implement the annotation of the music video, in a style between line-by-line and by stanza. I also used three images over the course of the music video. I also provided some simple styling through the style.css page. 

2. I did not directly collaborate on the assigment, but I stayed up to date with the Piazza posts and followed the "Double Rainbow" music video annotation example provided. 

3. I spent about 3 hours completing the assignment.
