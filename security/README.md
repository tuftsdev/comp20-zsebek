README for LAB 13


1.I believe that I was able to implement all components of the lab successfully, identifying 3 unique errors, and documenting them in an html document split into different components such as Introduction, Methodology, Abstract, Conclusion, and information about the problems themselves. 



2. I did not directly collaborate with anyone on this assignment, although I did follow the Piazza posts closely and used resources mentioned on the site. I also posted on Piazza to have some questions answered. 


3. I spent about 12 hours working on this assignment in total, and a few more hours going through some of the course materials to better understand the lab.
