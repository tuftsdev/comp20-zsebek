README for Messages Lab

1. After the work I've done, I believe that I correctly implemented the messages, displaying them in the correct order. Right now there is no specific styling, since that is to be done next week. To mimic the example output I put a space between the message and the username of the person who sent the message. 

2. I did not directly collaborate with others on this assignment, but followed the Piazza posts and examples / other resources given online. 

3. This lab took me about an hour and a half to complete in total.
